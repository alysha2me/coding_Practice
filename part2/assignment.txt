Now that you're totally fluent in file navigation with vim, let's practice some
actual coding practice.  If you want to keep the file open from the other folder
for a cheat sheet of vim, when you have vim open type
:vsplit ~/coding_Practice/part1/vim_practice_(2,3,4).cpp
Note that if your directory is different, you might need to replace ~/coding_Practice
with ~/...(Other containing folders).../coding_Practice.

==============
Start with cpp_practice_1.cpp and follow the instructions.  These are self-contained, so go in order.


When you're done, push your finished versions to github.
