This part investigates the use of classes and structures, basically
the same thing.  They're a way for you to keep track of a lot of 
distinct objects that all act the same way.  An example in our code
is cells in a tissue, or perhaps proteins in a blood clot. 

obj_practice_1.cpp has examples of defining structures and classes.

obj_practice_2.cpp has examples of using multiple classes together.

obj_practice_3.cpp/.h/main.cpp is a large example of how you would 
store these objects in practice. To compile this type "make all".
It will make some intermediate "object" (.o) files. Don't worry 
about these. To clear it up and recompile it, type "make clean" 
then "make all".  NOTE that the compiled program isn't a.out.

----------------------------------------
Notes on the makefile:
----------------------------------------

typing "make" into bash automatically executes "makefile",
and so these are industry standard names.

What it does is it runs commands like "g++ ...." to 
compile a large program in pieces.  

When you type "make all", it searches for the command words after "all".
You see, 
all: program 

And so it checks the program line, 

program:obj_practice_3.o Roster.o student.o 
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) obj_practice_3.o Roster.o student.o -o program.out


So, it first will check that the make commands "obj_practice_3.o" etc. are
executed.  So it will jump down to the obj_practice_3.o line,

obj_practice_3.o: obj_practice_3.cpp
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c obj_practice_3.cpp

and see if the output obj_practice_3.o has been made.  If not, 
it will check that obj_practice_3.cpp exists and then use it in
the line 
$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -c obj_practice_3.cpp

At the top, you see $(CXX) is substituted for -g++ -static-libstdc++
and you can add flags in to modify the compiler behavior, e.g. 
-Wall causes error messages to print out.

Lastly -c causes the compiler causes obj_practice_3.cpp to 
compile into an "object" file (.o), all of which will be tied together
into the program at the end of 

program:obj_practice_3.o Roster.o student.o 
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) obj_practice_3.o Roster.o student.o -o program.out
